# DEV Stack

As mentioned in [01-dev-setup.md](./01-dev-setup.md), we use a shared DEV stack.
This is defined in the [media-atom-maker-dev.yml](../cloudformation/media-atom-maker-dev.yml) template.

To apply an update to this stack, edit the template and apply the updated template via the AWS web console.
